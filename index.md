The Sparkbox Apprenticeship is loosely separated into three phases. Completing a phase provides a clear checkpoint for review, reflection, and closure.

### Phase 1 - *Source Control and Programming Basics*
Phase one explores the essential software toolset and uses them to establish proficiency regarding the foundations of software development through practical challenges.

### Phase 2 - *Frontend Development: Markup, Style, Interaction, and Preprocessing*
During Phase two, developers work with HTML and CSS to implement a product card layout.

[See the Phase 2 Curriculum →][]

### Phase 3 - *MVC Frameworks, Databases, and Personal Projects*
In Phase three, developers have the opportunity to put their newly acquired skills to good use building a working app via a fully agile process with project management, design, and even an internal "client."

### Phase "X" - *Career Preparedness Workshops*
Phase "X" is a bonus, four-week workshop designed to teach apprentices how to highlight their strengths, and how to approach the job market of the web industry.
