##### Career Preparedness Workshop

Learning development skills is a crucial part of the apprenticeship curriculum, but we also want the apprentices to feel prepared and fully equipped to be applying for and entering the web industry at the end of their time at Sparkbox. This workshop will help apprentices learn how to highlight their strengths, and how to approach the job market of the web industry.

Over 4 weeks, we cover the following using both lecture and hands on activities:
  * Part 1: Introduction and Resumes
  * Part 2: How to Really Read a Developer Job Posting and Cover Letters
  * Part 3: Interview Preparation and Salary Negotiation
  * Part 4: Open Job Preparedness work hour and Q&A Session. This is just an open hour to ask any lingering questions, and continue working on their resumes, cover letter, applying for jobs, and their web portfolio site.
